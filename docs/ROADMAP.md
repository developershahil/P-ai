# Roadmap (Current Scope)

This roadmap is intentionally limited to existing capabilities.

- Improve model quality using current intent dataset and active-learning samples.
- Track model metrics and version history over retraining cycles.
- Expand test coverage for parser/entities/intents/reminder internals.
- Maintain API auth and logging hardening.
- Keep packaging reproducible with PyInstaller script.
